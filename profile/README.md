The Predictive Phenomics Initiative (PPI)Â is an internal LDRD investment at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory focused on unraveling the mysteries of molecular function in complex biological systems. Explore software and source code materials by PPI research projects developing sophisticated models and analysis workflows for predicting and controlling the phenome. For a complete catalog of available PPI project source code outputs (not in active development at this repository), corresponding to [published articles](https://www.pnnl.gov/projects/predictive-phenomics-science-technology-initiative/publications) or linked [phenomics data packages](https://doi.org/10.25584/PPI/2441504) where applicable, visit the [PPI Zenodo Community Collection](https://zenodo.org/communities/pnnl-ppi).
